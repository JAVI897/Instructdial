[OPTIONS] yes||||no", "index": 70634, "split": "train", "metadata": {"context": ["Tl;dr: Ex who I've stayed friends with after 2 years has gotten in the habit of making me feel shitty for having moved on, and has now totally altered my and other friends' plans for New Year's at the mere suggestion that I might take a date with me.\n\nThe quick back story is that I dated a girl over 2 years ago and she ended up in my friend group as well. After we broke up we decided to make amends, because she's a good friend, quickly established herself in my friend group, and in particular is close with 2 sisters who I'm friends with.\n\nWhile her and I are generally platonic, she has a tendency to try and get affectionate like we used to and writes it off as \"that's just how I am\", even though she knows I don't want to do anything couple-like with her. She always seems to want to spend every chance we can together too, and any time we do things in the friend group I feel like I have to pay a certain amount of attention to her or else she'll get sad and make me feel bad the next day. We have drunkenly hooked up a few times since the break up, which I know doesn't help, but then she makes me feel guilty afterwards for thinking that it's a mistake when it happens. I don't want to hurt her, but I have no intention of getting back with her, and things like that just end up making her catch feelings for me that I'm not going to reciprocate.\n\nThere have been a few instances in the last few months that have really stood out. One weekend I had a friend visiting from out of state who I wanted to meet my new friend group, her included. This was important to me and she knew it. Instead she went totally dark for three days and wouldn't come out. She did this because, two days before, I had MENTIONED that I had a date the next night and that made her feel so jealous that she didn't think she could go out with our friends and have fun.\n\nAt a Halloween rave 14 of us went to, she stormed out in a huff at 1:30AM and sent my one friend and myself long, angry texts about how we abandoned her and how that hurt her so much. He and I were dancing with girls that we met and were 5 feet away from her, I could see her the entire time. There were a dozen other friends she could have found to hang out with, but she was mad at me and my best friend specifically because I was dancing with a girl that he hooked me up with.\n\nAlso, I go to a lot of concerts and she tends to come with. We have similar taste in music and schedules, so if I don't have anyone else in mind to go to a concert with, she's almost always available and willing. The last few weeks she's started to seem almost possessive about them. I mention a show I got tickets for and she almost assumes that she's going to come. Then when I say someone else is coming with she gets upset.\n\nYesterday took the cake. I finally found out that I'll be able to celebrate New Years (I have a job that works most holidays and I wasn't sure I'd be able to this year) and asked some friends if they had already made plans. Some had, but to something I don't really want to go to, and others hadn't, including her. She found a few events that we began narrowing down, but it's looking like the group would be me, her, and our two friends who are a couple.\n\nThen she asked me if I was thinking of bringing a date and I told her yes, I've met someone that I would like to ask, but we only just started seeing each other and she may already have plans. All of a sudden, because I suggested that I *might* bring a date, she decided to go to the event our other friend is going to that she originally has said for weeks that she didn't have any interest in.

Me(30 M) and my girlfriend (24/F) of 6 months just had a blow up fight. It ended with me telling her maybe she should leave and think about if she wants this relationship.\n\nBasically, we have had several arguments over a few things I say or do that make her upset(joking about certain issues, responding to her in a sarcastic manner, not taking life seriously enough). Every time ive apologized and owned up to the action, I've genuinely been trying to change and actually have an appointment for therapy this week bc I know how I can be sometimes. I don't mean to say these things but I just say them for some reason, I don't seem to really grasp the consequences of my actions at times.\n\nAnyway topics of the arguments are not really that important as the main thing is her reaction. The silent treatment. One word answers and complete cold shoulder, like leave the room or move away from you when try to touch her. This will go on for days. She will not even tell me why she is upset, only that I \"should know\". I always want to talk things out, bc ive learned how important communication is in a relationship and for any relationship to work you have to communicate.\n\nSo, the past few days have been a decent amount silent treatment stemming from an argument regarding me treating her differently when my roommate is around. We solved that with a blow up fight when she was drunk, which culminated with a slap to my face bc I had been lying to her(spoiler: I haven't been). I just let it slide due to the drunkenness.\n\nSo I confronted her about it, albeit in a poor manner(straight away told her it has to stop), as I was pretty upset. An argument ensued, which was pretty heated, and I told her to leave and think if she wants to do this. She storms out, only to call me a few minutes later and ultimately come back to my place, on her own decision, and talk further. We chatted for a bit and some of her reasoning is sound(wants me to be successful, I need to stop my drug use, need to be done with the bachelor life). However, I asked her about hitting me and she believes there is nothing wrong with it and will do it again no questions asked. Also, I told her about therapy and she thinks its only for \"weak\" people who \"need excuses\". So after this, she stayed the night, only to leave in the morning and tell me \"I need to think if I want to do this\".\n\nAnnnnnd just for further complication, I really love this girl and feel like she \"the one\".\n\nWell guys/gals, what's your opinion? Try to work it out? Or cut the cord?\n\nThanks for reading and feel free to ask any questions.\n\n---\n\n**tl;dr**: GF gives me the silent treatment when I piss her off, told her to stop, she said no.

Generate a response that gives advice to solve the issue.\nInput: [CONTEXT] I'm getting married in a couple of months and my mom wants to have a picture of my dad at the front. He died when I was a teenager and he was a horrible abusive alcoholic who eventually killed himself but used to beat me and my mom on the regular. It was really a relief that he died. My mom has always refused to acknowledge his abuse after he died. It used to bother me when I was younger because I wanted it to be acknowledged and for him to be remembered as who he was, but now that I'm older I understand it's just how she grieves. Didn't really bother me much that she needed that. Now, I'm getting married and she's really pushing for a photo of him there. I got upset about this the other day and she did acknowledge his abuse but says it was due to his alcoholism and he was actually a great man. This is just an important day for me, and I found a partner that I really want to celebrate being married to. Am I being petty about this? I've made a lot of concessions when it comes to wedding size, style, etc for my mom. She is paying for the wedding but it's because she wants to have a big Indian wedding and I do not. She's paying for it because otherwise I would have likely eloped.

The comment was fairly well received, so yesterday I started working with several users and moderators of this sub to write this new bot. It is fairly simple and relatively \"dumb.\" It (attempts) to use a series of patterns to determine if the user included a location in their question (title or post.) If the user forgot to include this information, it will kindly remind them that they should edit the original post to include this information. This will (should) help with the timeliness and accuracy of the responses in the sub. Initial testing in a private subreddit went well, and it appears to catch most of the cases. As someone who is not a lawyer, but gets a lot out of this subreddit (I enjoy reading just about every post, I'll even do my own research and try to find an answer (sometimes,)) I figured it was the least I could do. You may have noticed that the bot replied to some posts that are older when it initially ran on the live subreddit. As the bot continues to run (it looks for new posts every minute or so) this will be a non-issue. If you have questions/comments/feedback, let me know! Ian [RESPONSE] I've been with my guy for almost 11 years, married for six. He's amazing - smart, funny, kind, and hella sexy. He's the best thing that has ever happened to me.

{"text": "", "output": "Why are you working for free, for a company that's making money? Because you \"like programming\"? You have two options.", "metadata": {"context": ["Both 20m's. 6 months working together. I offered free help to volunteer code part of a start-up website in September. This was fine, I had nothing else to do, and quite frankly he needed help badly fixing not only the code to make it faster/shorter/bug free but also secure (e.g. taking non-working 1500 line scripts and making them into 400, working/bug free scripts). This went on for several months and at a point I suggested working on a completely new re-code, because of the complexities in the code and huge problems we were having.\n\nThe site launched, and has been up for a couple months now. It's profitable, and I'm happy to have helped. However, I've been feeling a little frustrated and put off recently. Keeping in mind I was doing what I was doing for free (and not wanting anything in return) I was asked to set up something to replace an existing chat method for users. This took over 8 hours of work, and probably around 10 or 11. Then, when I asked why he didn't switch over, I was told it was because the players didn't want to switch. So I explained to him the above and about working for free and how I had just wasted 8-10 hours on something that won't be used.\n\nNow, originally I had only offered to do programming, as I am proficient in PHP/SQL/database(s). Multiple times I have also been asked to do other things, without going into technicalities that are basically server administration tasks. Further, the person who I volunteered to do stuff for no longer seems to be actively doing anything himself, and unable to figure anything out short of turning to me.\n\nSo basically, the site's turning a profit through donations, servers have been upgraded to fully dedicated servers (100$/mo), I've been given full access to everything, even as far as access to the billing information should I ever need to access it. But this brings me to my problem. Now he's asked that I do a solo re-code of the site to bring about completely new features and new things that should bring even more visitors. I originally agreed, because I enjoy programming and it was a good way for me to de-stress and something to focus on.\n\nBUT: I feel that I'm wasting my time. I'm still insanely pissed off that I worked 8-10hrs on something that wasn't even used. A huge waste of time. I'm also insanely pissed off that it's now starting to show that he's incompetent to the extent of not being able to do what I would consider basic server administration, basic coding and instead pushes it all off onto me because I have the talent and knowledge of doing it myself. At the same time I will admit, it's evident I have talent, so why should I waste my time coding something for someone that's going to turn a profit for them in the long run, of which, I will be receiving none of myself.\n\ntl;dr - volunteering to code has now turned into other responsibilities involving the web server, doing other admin tasks. Constantly asked to do thing which are basic. I'm the reason that a good portion of this website is up, running, secure, and has turned a profit.

What's your relationship with her like?", "metadata": {"context": ["Background:\n\nHusband and I got married 2 weeks ago. My MIL has 3 younger children (10F, 8M, 5F). She wants to take them to Disneyland before the youngest boy turns 10, because once he\u2019s over 10 it\u2019s adult pricing. This trip has been talked about for over 6 months.\n\nSo when this trip was brought up, I brought up straight away that I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d be able to take time off for the trip due to my work schedule. I am an elementary school tutor with about 20-30 students that all require individual lesson planning. She has said a few different dates that she wants to take the trip, one was May 2019 - which I for sure can\u2019t do because my grade 3 students will be preparing for testing. She also has said September 2019- which I can\u2019t do because it\u2019s the beginning of the school year and I\u2019ll need to be doing assessments on new students. The final date is the second week of January 2019 - for Christmas break I always have off from the Friday before Christmas, until the 2nd week of January. When she wants to go to Disney, would be the week I go back to work.\n\nBefore the wedding I had to take off 5 days. Which left me with 27 individual lesson plans to prepare and print. This was incredibly stressful and not something I\u2019m interested in doing again. I\u2019ve told my MIL multiple times that if she wants us to come, it needs to be a time that I\u2019m not working. She just continues to say that I can take the time off, and 5 days off work will be fine.\n\nI don\u2019t know how many more times I can tell her or try to get through to her that if it\u2019s not when I\u2019m off - we\u2019re not coming. Especially because we\u2019ll have to pay our own way of course. This isn\u2019t a trip either of us are super excited to go on as my husband hates rides. The only reason we are possibly going is because of the kids. I feel like my husbands parents are having a hard time accepting that their son isn\u2019t someone they can just make these plans for and force him to go on anymore (they haven\u2019t gone on a vacation since high school - so this is their first trip with him as an adult)\n\nBasically, how else can I explain that we will not be able to go unless it\u2019s during my off time? I don\u2019t want to sacrifice my students education.\n\nTl;dr: MIL is adamant about husband and I coming on a trip next year, despite me saying multiple times that I can\u2019t go unless it\u2019s during my off time from work as it\u2019s too stressful planning wise and sacrifices my students learning.

My ex, let's call him POS, and I were married for 4 years. We're still technically married but are in the process of getting divorced. POS and I parted ways after I found out that he'd been having an affair with his sister's best friend. Needless to say that was particularly traumatic because this was a woman that I had known for so long and welcomed into my home, only to have her participate in the ruination of my marriage. But *that* is a story for another day. Soon after we split, I found out that I was pregnant.

The new principal there told the special ed teacher in my friend's class they were going to be fired at the end of the year, in the middle of the year, and made them and the other special ed teachers change their curriculum halfway through the year, disregarding all the work they had done already and basing their performance off of the new stuff that they didn't even give them all the resources they need to do it as they wanted. Since then the teacher and the principal have had problems (like always finding something wrong with what the teachers are doing even though they have no experience with special ed kids, singling the class out during assemblies (i.e. \"I hope everyone is doing good, '*special ed teacher*''s class I hope you're behaving :) \", stuff like that), and though it might not be related to the actions mentioned below, I hope it can help paint a picture of the situation at hand before these most recent events.\n\nJust a while ago, the school arranged for an entire grade of students to go on a field trip. But the special ed teacher was told that, unfortunately, there just wasn't enough room on the busses for the kids in their class that were supposed to go (4 kids btw). It doesn't matter that this has never been a problem before or that they've supposedly been planning this trip for a long while now and knew that there are students in the special ed class that are supposed to go (they gave the kids permission slips and everything), they just... Didn't have enough room. They also gave no apology, no alternative to the teachers, no offer for something for the kids to do, they just took every single student in that grade except for the 4 special ed kids. Not only was this a bit degrading to the students, but my friend found out by talking to some of the parents that there were open seats on the busses. More than 4 open seats.\n\nThe next field trip there isn't a problem with them \"forgetting\" specific students, but the special ed teacher noticed that there's one nice bus, and the rest of the busses are crap. They line up for one of the crap ones because the nice one was already filled, okay whatever. It's bad luck. So this most recent field trip, they get to the busses early. And like before, there's one really nice charter bus, and then the rest were not too great. They line up in front of the nice bus, no problems, everyone else is going up to the other busses as well, when a staff member comes up to the special ed teacher and tells them that this isn't their bus, and makes them move to one of the other busses.

[ENDOFDIALOGUE] [QUESTION] Is the response appropriate?  [OPTIONS] yes||||no", "index": 148469, "split": "train", "metadata": {"context": ["Before my boyfriend, Eli, dated me, he was living in the Pacific Northwest for 2 years. While there, he met a woman, Anja, who was Polish and visiting friends briefly. They hung out one time and then she went back to Poland. They had a long distance relationship for several months to maybe a little less than a year. He tried learning Polish for her, but he never went to visit and she never came back to the States. He told me that they're still friends and talk every once in a while. He and I have been together a year and a half, and about once a month he'll mention talking to her and catching up. He's actually in semi-contact with most of his exes save for maybe two, and is at least Facebook friends with them or follows them on some social media, and catches up with them every once in a while, maybe once or twice a year. All of them are long distance and spread out over the country.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Eli was out running an errand and I was rooting around in his bike bag for some things of mine he'd stashed in there. I found this tiny notebook, like the type you'd carry around to write in (I'm a writing major and he writes for a hobby). I know this was a huge invasion of privacy and I hate that I did it, but curiosity got the best of me. Only a few pages were taken up in the book, but most of them were all about Anja, his ex. The writing was super intimidate--poetry and love letters, going on and on about how he'd never felt so close to anyone else and she made him a better man, and he wished he could be with her. I was kind of taken aback, but I knew he'd really cared about her, so wasn't too bothered. Mostly, I was a little confused because they'd broken up years ago, long before he and I got together. Then I got to the last page, which was a sort of dated journal entry talking about inane stuff, but he mentioned having talked to Anja and how he hoped she was doing well, that he missed talking to her sometimes. The date on the entry was after we had been dating (3 months or so in).\n\nSo, I was sort of bothered that he was carrying around this notebook with stuff about Anja in it, but I didn't mention it. I knew he hadn't done much writing lately, so I figured he just hadn't kept up with the notebook. I was a little bummed there was nothing about me in there (stupid, I know), but I put it out of my mind.\n\nSeveral days later, he and I were talking about future things. We're moving in together this summer, and he's saving up for a ring so he can propose either this December or early 2016. We want to have a really cheap wedding so we can do an awesome honeymoon, so we've been throwing around ideas to save up for, with our sights set on backpacking parts of Europe. My family is actually Polish, and I mentioned wanting to visit Auschwitz (where my grandmother was held) and maybe Warsaw, where she had lived. Eli then brought up dropping into Krak\u00f3w, so we can see and stay with Anja and she can show us around. I was a little uncomfortable, but said that might be cool and dropped it. I just feel a little weird hanging out with his ex on OUR honeymoon\n\nYesterday, I was updatinghim about a month-long backpacking trip my best friends and I are saving up for as a graduation gift to ourselves. I mentioned us wanting to go to Prague, and Eli immediately jumped in saying that Anja had just gotten a job in a city near the Czech border, so he should tell her when I'll be there so she and I can meet and hang out. I had no idea what to say to that, so I just quickly made up something about us being on a tight schedule.\n\nTo top everything off, today I haven't talked to Eli much.

I've only ever remained friends with one ex, and that's because we dated as teenagers then wound up at the same college. It's weird to me to keep those people in my life. But I guess it's a good sign that he wants me to meet her? I guess I'm just confused. Is his relationship with her something I should worry about? If so, how do I talk to him about this? If I should drop it, how do I get over this? **tl;dr**: BF wrote really intimate stuff about his ex, and I found it. They're still in touch and I'm insecure. [RESPONSE] This is a situation that makes guys like myself go crazy. First his privacy is invaded, and you read something personal to him. Fine. It happens. But then you don't tell him about it, so now you're carrying your own secret. Why? I have no idea. You've now let it build up and spiral into a deeper problem without communicating to him, all the while he's being pretty awesome about communicating with you. Ex's are a mine field of insecurities and potential problems, and he's been open so as to avoid that. He's including you in the relationship he has with his ex, and is even trying to cultivate one between you two so that you can feel more secure. Very few men are that mature or considerate.

This led to a match at SuperBrawl IX where Mysterio and tag partner Konnan lost a \"Hair vs. Mask match\" against Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, forcing Mysterio to remove his mask. After the match, he phoned his uncle to tell him the news. Mysterio has publicly expressed his disappointment over being unmasked: Mysterio later became a \"giant killer\" by defeating large opponents such as Kevin Nash, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Scott Norton. He faced Nash at Uncensored in a match where Lex Luger interfered and helped Nash in winning the match. Although he participated in several notable matches with some of the heavyweight top card wrestlers, it was made very clear to him that he would never receive a push to become a main eventer. This was due to Eric Bischoff utilizing cruiserweights as alternative, mid-card entertainment as opposed to the more conventional style that led WCW programming. The next night on the March 15 Nitro, he defeated Billy Kidman to win his fifth Cruiserweight Championship. On the March 22 Spring Breakout episode of Nitro, Mysterio got his first shot at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against champion Ric Flair when the names of (allegedly) nearly everyone in the company were put into a hat and a lottery was held.

Mysterio refused to take off his LWO colors and was attacked by the nWo as a result. This led to a match at SuperBrawl IX where Mysterio and tag partner Konnan lost a \"Hair vs. Mask match\" against Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, forcing Mysterio to remove his mask. After the match, he phoned his uncle to tell him the news. Mysterio has publicly expressed his disappointment over being unmasked: Mysterio later became a \"giant killer\" by defeating large opponents such as Kevin Nash, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Scott Norton. He faced Nash at Uncensored in a match where Lex Luger interfered and helped Nash in winning the match. Although he participated in several notable matches with some of the heavyweight top card wrestlers, it was made very clear to him that he would never receive a push to become a main eventer. This was due to Eric Bischoff utilizing cruiserweights as alternative, mid-card entertainment as opposed to the more conventional style that led WCW programming. The next night on the March 15 Nitro, he defeated Billy Kidman to win his fifth Cruiserweight Championship. On the March 22 Spring Breakout episode of Nitro, Mysterio got his first shot at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against champion Ric Flair when the names of (allegedly) nearly everyone in the company were put into a hat and a lottery was held.

We discussed this and agreed on this about 8 months ago when I realized I wouldn\u2019t be able to finish my degree working mon-fri (I am majoring in Biology and almost all lab options are during the day). We split house work 50/50. Sometimes I do more, sometimes he does more. Sex life is okay - no major changes recently and we both have communicated that we are happy with the frequency.

Boyfriend insists on surprise proposal with ring but keeps putting it off. I have no health insurance and we agreed that I could get on his when we get married. Lots of financial changes have happened since the ruined proposal, and he is making twice as much as he was last year, while I am in school full time and work part time. I am starting to not even want to get married because it is becoming such a stressor to me.\n\nSo, boyfriend and I have been together almost 4 years, living together for almost two years. We have had our share of communication problems in the past - he doesn\u2019t bring things up when they bother him, and instead waits weeks or even months later until we have a disagreement and then unleashes pent up anger. We have talked about this at length over the course of our relationship, and it has improved slightly. I struggle with anxiety and I tend to over-plan everything and can definitely be overwhelming at times. I tend to want to talk about things TOO much for his taste. I\u2019m trying to get better at not being a micromanager when it comes to his choices and our future - which brings me to this post!\n\nOur relationship is great. I can honestly say he is my best friend, and he has been so supportive of me as I decided to go back to school full time to finish my degree. About a year ago (April 2018) we began seriously discussing marriage. I told him I didn\u2019t want a proposal, ring, or traditional wedding but I would be willing to compromise if any of those things were important to him. He said a ring and proposal are both important to him, and he said that he had already talked to his parents and was planning a surprise proposal with his grandmother\u2019s ring. His grandma passed away about 8-9 years ago and they were close. I was surprised and really touched, so I agreed a surprise proposal would be ok. I told him I\u2019d still rather have a court house wedding, but if he wants a wedding with friends and family we can compromise with a small wedding. I\u2019m really frugal and I don\u2019t want to spend more than a few hundred dollars on a wedding ideally, but would be willing to spend $2-3000 total if it was important to him. I just would rather save up for a down payment on house. We rent a house now.\n\nFor about 6 months after that conversation, I became obsessed with the idea of a surprise proposal. It gave me so much anxiety. I kept thinking he was proposing every time we went on a date or planned anything, and I was worried about how I looked (I knew we would take pictures after a proposal so I felt like I always had to wear makeup, nice clothes, have presentable hair). I was worried that I wouldn\u2019t react the way he wanted me to react when he proposed out of nervousness. I cried on my birthday (in private, he still doesn\u2019t know) because he took me to see a play and I thought he was going to propose. I was disappointed at the end of the summer because he didn\u2019t propose when I actually had time off of school and we had more time to do couple stuff. Our three year anniversary was in September, and in the weeks leading up to it we got in an argument about the broken side mirror on his car. It had been broken for over a year at that point and I kept asking when he was going to fix it ( for over a year), and he kept telling me he was going to fix it next week, next month, over the weekend - he just kept pushing it off. I made a stupid comment to the effect of, \u201cI think you\u2019ll fix that mirror when you propose: never.\u201d He angrily told me that he was planning a proposal on our anniversary, but now I ruined it because it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise.\n\nI figured he would propose over the holidays.

{"text": "", "output": "I want to start by saying that your dad is an asshole. I don't care when he was raised, he needs to be a good father to his sons and he's not being a good father right now. I understand he's been good to you but he's being awful, truly awful to your brother.", "metadata": {"context": ["I was going to make this post a couple nights ago but decided to wait until the situation cooled down with hopes it would work itself out. Unfortunately, it... hasn't. This is a long story and I'm going to try to sum it up as efficiently as possible with the hope of getting some outside perspective, since it's clearly a very fraught area and I don't know what the hell to say or do right now.\n\n My brother (I'm going to call him Dan) is two years older than me and our relationship has always been tricky. We went through a long period of not being particularly close after he broke my trust very significantly in our early twenties, but over the past couple years, he's been reaching out more and we're becoming friendly. Part of this is because he moved back to the city where we grew up - he has always been a very driven and ambitious person and I think always looked down on me for not wanting to leave our hometown, but now that he's living here again (even though he doesn't see it as a failure or a demotion, he moved here for an impressive new job and everyone in the family is proud of him), we have actually become friendly and I enjoy spending time with him again. The other part of this is that two years ago, Dan got married to his boyfriend, who I'll call Jon. Jon has since become one of my good friends well; he moved here not knowing anyone but Dan and I reached out to him because I sensed that he was feeling isolated. He's a good guy and fits in with my buddies, so we've spent a lot of time hanging out together over the past couple years. He's also told me some things about Dan in confidence that have given me a better understanding of who he is - my brother is a very secretive person, and I didn't know until Jon told me that he is diagnosed with bipolar II and medicated/in therapy, for instance.\n\nAnyway, when Dan and Jon became engaged I knew our father wasn't really thrilled about it, but I didn't think much of it. Dan has dated women in the past and I think our dad really thought/hoped that he would end up with one. Our family is Catholic, though Dan isn't religious, and our father is fairly conservative (I'm an observant Catholic as well but I see other people's sexuality as none of my business. I have three kids and if any of them were to come out to me in the future I would make it my business to let them know that they're loved no matter what). Dad never said anything to Dan's face about the engagement or the marriage, but even when we were growing up he was very concerned with our being traditionally masculine and really stressed the \"boys don't cry\"/\"real men do this\" type rhetoric when we were growing up. He's from a different era and I don't begrudge him the attitudes he grew up with, but I could tell he was always dissatisified with both of us in this regard particularly (if anything, Dan is more stoic and traditionally masculine than I am, but that's neither here nor there). Anyway, he's never said anything outright homophobic to Dan since he and Jon have been together, but he dragged his feet putting up a print of their wedding picture next to my own in his house, for instance, and it's just always been clear that he doesn't see their marriage as being equal to my own.\n\n(This also feels like a good time to point out that dad and I have actually always been closer throughout our lives, and vice versa with Dan and our mom. I spend time with Dad on a pretty regular basis but he rarely spends one-on-one time with Dan, and that's just how it always has been. I always got the sense that Dan didn't have a high opinion of our father, but like I said, he's a secretive person who plays his cards pretty close, so I don't really know specifics of how they relate to each other.)\n\nAnyway, this all brings us to two nights ago. Our parents had Dan, Jon, my wife and me over for Sunday dinner and at one point the subject turned to the holidays, and our dad told me and Dan that we should bring \"the wives and the kids\" to join them for Christmas this year instead of going on vacation as we did last year. At which point Dan very calmly, but coldly, told our father that he needs to respect Jon and his marriage, that they are both men and that he's tired of having his relationship treated like it doesn't matter; to which our dad responded, \"I just want to know when you're going to stop fucking around with guys and get serious.\" Which went over about as well as you'd think. Dan blew up and started shouting about how Dad has always disrespected him and Dad got equally angry and said that that if Dan respected him, he wouldn't have married \"that f-----t.\" (I should also point out that Jon is 6'6\", has a beard and plays sports and video games as a hobby, and there is nothing feminine or even stereotypically gay about him OR my brother. If you met either of them separately you'd have no idea that either of them is married to another guy, so dad's comment calling Jon his \"wife\" was really out of nowhere.)\n\nDan's response was to bring me into it and compare the way dad treats my marriage and wife versus the way he treats Dan's marriage and Jon. I tried to defuse the situation but Dan told me to stay out of it, which I still think is fundamentally unfair. Jon looked really upset by this point and was telling Dan that they should just leave, and they finally did, but not before our mom started crying and dad told Dan that he was no longer welcome at their house for Thanksgiving or Christmas.\n\nYesterday I stopped by Dan and Jon's house to drop off a book they had lent me and Dan was home, but refused to speak to me. Jon says that he's angry that I didn't try to step in and defend him during the argument and thinks that I agree with our dad. I reiterated that I DID try, but Dan told me to stay out of it, and Jon shrugged it off and said that Dan would eventually cool down and it would blow over. Jon says he knows where I stand and that he'd try to talk to Dan about it. HOWEVER, I feel like Dan has put me in an unfair position here. He has historically not been a great brother to me, but has made huge strides over the past couple years and is essentially a different person now than he was twenty and even ten years ago. Our dad, meanwhile, has ALWAYS been there for me, but I can't in good conscience take his side and support the way he treats Dan and his marriage to Jon, who has genuinely become one of my good friends.\n\n**tl;dr**: Dad and brother got in massive fight over brother's marriage to another man; brother is now angry at me for not taking his side even though I actually tried to.

I don\u2019t know what to do, it may as well be a dating site, it\u2019s really no different.

We really hit it off when we first met at a party and ended up talking for hours and hours... Right off the bat though she was quite open about the fact that she identified herself as a gender-neutral bisexual (meaning she doesn't identify as any gender and doesn't like being referred to by female pronouns like \"her, she, girlfriend, etc...\"). At first this really was not a problem for me, I actually thought it was quite interesting and admirable.\n\nNow it's important to note that I do not hold any prejudice against any individual regarding their sexuality.\n\nBut for the past week of so I just can't shake off this feeling that I'm finding hard to explain... Now that the relationship has obviously become more intimate and I've been getting to know \"her\" very well, I'm starting to ask myself questions that just stress me out... I haven't felt this way about a girl in a while, there are so many amazing things about her and I absolutely love spending time with her. We get on so well that I just feel like she's a new best friend as well. We are sexually intimate and she does show attraction to my masculinity. She has made it very clear in a lot of sweet ways that she has plenty of feelings for me. She is seriously committed to me and is quite serious about this relationship. But I still find it difficult that she for one doesn't identify as a female (not to be confused with transsexuality) and is bisexual.\n\nI fill my thoughts nowadays with superficial concerns like: Will she leave me for a woman after being bored with dating a man? Is this a phase and I'm the turning point to her becoming a lesbian, or perhaps even transexual? She once told me that she has had relationships with women and I'm of course not demeaning the idea of a homosexual relationship, I just have it tough imagining my partner intimate with another woman. She also recently came out to her parents (her parents took it all very well) as a \"bisexual\" and immediately after that told them that she's recently been dating a guy (me). I feel almost as if I'm being used as a 'safety net' of sorts... like \"mom, dad, I'm bisexual but I have a boyfriend\"... Almost as if it'll soften the blow.\n\nIf I'm being absolutely honest it's making me feel quite insecure about myself as a partner and as a man. I would love to know if what I'm feeling is just utter nonsense from lack of experience... Perhaps I'm being to harsh on the circumstance? I'm quite the romantic and am absolutely fond of the idea of being in a relationship with someone for a long time. I'd love to hear some advice on how to approach this with the eventual goal to discuss all my feelings with my partner. I don't want to accuse her of anything, she obviously hasn't done anything wrong.

It is nice to receive attention, but now it\u2019s almost making me uncomfortable because we\u2019re in each other\u2019s faces every day. I\u2019ve been single five years prior to us dating so I\u2019m not used to being with someone all the time. I\u2019ve come to realize I actually enjoy being alone most times, and now I need my space more than ever because I get my life together. I\u2019m graduating college soon, I need to find employment and improve my mental health.\n\nAnother thing about my boyfriend is his lifestyle. He does have a job, but he deals weed to make extra income. I don\u2019t think it makes him a bad person, but it is risky since it\u2019s not legal where we live. I won\u2019t make him stop dealing but I do need to leave because I cannot risk my safety and future endeavors if I continue to associate myself with him. We weren\u2019t directly involved in it, but did have a scare a few days ago with some people we knew who were dealing, and even though it was a false alarm, it is a wake-up call for me and I need to act on it while I still can.\n\nHe knows I\u2019m not used to the drug-dealing environment and he won\u2019t make me do anything I\u2019m not comfortable with, so he does respect my preference to not smoke at all or be around when he\u2019s dealing. He also understands I\u2019m inexperienced in dating, and with us in particular, our relationship was out of the blue and we did move a bit fast, so he does care about how I feel about our pace and considers my needs.\n\nWe don\u2019t live together but most nights he sleeps at my place. A few of his things are there and I\u2019d feel bad if I had to tell him to leave and take his stuff out with him. Most times I\u2019ve politely declined, but on some occasions he has bought me some things and I\u2019m afraid he might guilt trip me and throw it back in my face should I talk about leaving him.\n\nWe haven\u2019t dated very long but he thinks the world of me. He thinks I\u2019m amazing even on my worst days. He really is a sweet guy. But he also has trust issues from his past (his ex cheated on him) so he might get insecure and think I might leave him for someone else. I also gave my virginity to him, which might make his insecurities worse, so he might hold it over my head and believe I\u2019ll have sex with other men (which I won\u2019t do, and is a whole other conversation in itself). I know it\u2019s going to crush him and I hate it, but it\u2019s best for us as it will allow us to get our own lives together. I can\u2019t guarantee that we would be friends after this, but I really need my own space now and I\u2019ve already made up my mind. I\u2019m just not compatible with him and I\u2019m not willing to negotiate.\n\nI\u2019m out of town at the moment and won\u2019t be back for a week, so I wanna use this time to get my thoughts together. He has my key and I let him stay at my place so he can travel to work quicker, so breaking it off now is definitely not ideal. Don\u2019t wanna risk losing my things out of his spite while I\u2019m gone.\n\nTLDR: I want to break up with boyfriend and have two reasons. I need some space, and him dealing makes me uncomfortable and unsafe.\nShould I address both of these reasons, or which one should I say to him to make him understand? Should I break up with him right when I get back in town or wait a while (days/weeks) to have the conversation with him in person, via-text, with a friend present, etc?"], "response": null, "intent": null, "acts": null, "classes_in_options": null, "candidates": null, "action": null, "sys_act": null, "condition_response_str": null, "chosen_transform": null, "emotion": null, "endswith": null, "document": null, "missing_response": null, "swapped_response": null, "graph": null, "keywords": null, "persona": null, "strategy": null, "slot_label": null, "target": null}, "dataset": "reddit-advice", "input": "[CONTEXT] of the blue and we did move a bit fast, so he does care about how I feel about our pace and considers my needs.

I would be more worried about her vengeance and disregard for human emotion than the money although I do get why you\u2019re upset about the emergency fund.", "index": 163614, "split": "train", "metadata": {"context": ["FWIW This is not a post asking for any legal or financial advice, we already have a lawyer and have help financially. No offense to reddit, but I\u2019d rather not get any legal advice from a forum, but I\u2019m okay getting relationship advice it seems.\n\nAs the title states my wife was recently sued, she lost and we had to pay. The money is a significant amount for us, we didn\u2019t have much in savings or our emergency fund to begin with, and both of those accounts are now empty.\n\nMy currently problem is trying to move past the resentment and anger I\u2019m feeling towards my wife. Until now I\u2019ve always felt like we were a partnership in our marriage. But, since I\u2019m the breadwinner I can\u2019t help but to feel like I\u2019m spending \"my\" money on something that isn\u2019t my fault. I\u2019ve had no problem paying the mortgage, and taking care of various financial burdens that come with being a married homeowner. However, I have been the only one to put money aside in our savings and other accounts to prepare for an emergency - like a totaled car, someone loses their job, medical bills, or an act of god\u2026 not a stupid lawsuit where I know my wife is guilty. She has a part time job and doesn\u2019t make much money, but pays for smaller things when she can (like groceries and some random bills), but she does take care of a lot of cooking, cleaning and caring for our pets.\n\nWhat did my wife do? (Note: I had no idea this was going on while it was happening).\n\nShe used linkedin to find her former ex best friend, she ended up creating a realistic looking fake linkedin profile with a vague occupation of \u2018recruiter\u2019. My wife ended up sending this ex-best friend, \"Laura\" a few messages pretending to be a recruiter in her line of work. Laura finally responded thinking that this recruiter was real, my wife wanted her phone number but Laura gave her a personal email address instead. My wife created a second fake linkedin profile and started to send messages to people with similar titles as Laura at her company. These messages said derogatory things about Laura, a mixture of truthful things but embarrassing and just fabricated bullshit to make Laura look bad. Her manager got one of these messages that claimed that Laura was a heavy drug user. Laura's manager talked to her about these messages and he felt like the messages were bizarre and seemed like someone was trying to troll or harass Laura. Well, Laura team had her back and helped her saved these messages. Not only that, but Laura requested that she be drug tested anyway, to provide further evidence that she was clean. My wife didn\u2019t know this at this point, but Laura was pregnant. Several of her coworkers, including her manager testified on Laura behalf.\n\nUsing the personal email address she got from the fake recruiter profile, she was able to find a few social media platforms Laura was on and was able to figure out her husbands name. She did some more internet sleuthing and found Laura's husband on facebook. Laura's husband didn\u2019t have much on his facebook profile, but you could see his business email address on it. My wife sent him an email claiming that Laura was cheating on him. The husband confronted Laura about this email and Laura encouraged him to keep responding to this person, and save the messages, as well as to start asking specific questions about this supposed affair. My wife thought she was being clever and ended up telling the husband that Laura was cheating on him during the work week, she even gave him specific dates. What she didn\u2019t realize was Laura had something turned on in google maps where it keeps years worth of historical gps data. Some of the dates my wife gave him also happened to be days where they both worked from home together. She also ended up giving him dates during a time they were on vacation together. Laura had her husband keep responding as much as possible to my wife and to backup all correspondence.\n\nMy wife was able to  find out when and where the baby shower was going to be. One of Laura friends had created a public registry for her and had the invitation online. My wife decided to show up unannounced (the baby shower took place in a semi-public place, they had rented out an area connected to the public business.) She did not make herself known immediately. Instead she looked for patrons that were entering and exiting the rented out room. She was able to get the attention of a few guests that had never met her and tried to gossip about Laura - my wife was telling people that Laura didn\u2019t actually know who the father was, among other things. This was at an event where her husband was at as well. The word got back around to Laura and she spotted my wife and apparently immediately put together all the pieces of what happened.\n\nI\u2019m leaving a fair amount of information out - My wife was able to find phone numbers, social media accounts and email for other people in Laura circle and sent them messages about Laura on multiple occasions. All the messages were trying to paint Laura in an extremely derogatory light. All the events I\u2019ve mentioned so far took place over a year or so. My wife didn\u2019t think to mask her IP address, so it was pretty easy to find out that all of these made up messages came from the same IP address, ours. Many of Laura's friends and family testified on her behalf, Laura had everyone saved as much digital evidence as possible - and it was a lot.\n\nLaura and her husband hired a lawyer and decided to sue to my wife. They had ample evidence against her. All the saved messages, close friends and even her manager spoke on her behalf, she showed that she went to see a therapist once all the harassment started because she was depressed and anxious, she showed that she and her husband went to counseling after the accusations of her cheating. She even went above and beyond and had more drug tests done to show she was clean and my wife\u2019s accusations were 100% false, and even had a paternity test done to show that my wife was again wrong and chose to lie.\n\nI honestly felt awful for Laura, there were lots of tears on her end. You could tell how much emotional stress she had gone through. She said that being pregnant during the majority of this was absolutely horrific and was worried the stress and anxiety would somehow hurt her baby. She was pained that her one and only baby shower was ruined by my wife and that was something that could never be truly repaid or made up for. And that my wife\u2019s harassment continued even after Laura gave birth and was trying to manage a newborn child.\n\nMy wife has never done anything this crazy before. I knew she could be a little petty and jealous of others, especially people she use to be friends with in the past, but it was only talk - no action. We\u2019ve had a very happy marriage otherwise, we rarely fight, have a lot in common, we have a lot of fun together. But, she really fucked up this time. I don\u2019t know how to move forward. I know someone is going to suggest therapy, but I really want to start building up an emergency fund again. We\u2019re pretty screwed financially for awhile.\n\n**tl;dr** Wife was sued by her former best friend, I emptied out all of our savings and sold a few things to pay for everything.

Everything is amazing for the most part: we have a ton of things in common, we work in the same domain, we have lots of fun together, we constantly laugh and I can be myself around my boyfriend at all times...all that kind of corny good stuff.\n\nSometimes though, I feel like I love him more than he loves me, and it leaves me extremely sad. For example whenever we go out and I'm all dressed up and pretty, he never seems to notice or compliment me, so compliments from other boys just seem sad to me, if that makes any sense. I feel like the person whom I really want to notice me doesn't, as shallow as that may sound.\nAlso, I feel like usually he seems kind of embarrassed to display any public affection towards me, also online-he never posts or tags any pictures of me (I know, I sound shallow again, but he does it in a way that is pretty noticeable). Sometimes I say I love you and he doesn't say it back, and he usually doesn't seem too sexually interested in me.. These are the small things that kind of add up in my mind.\n\nMy biggest problem in this whole thing though is that I see him like other girls pictures online, girls that he doesn't know personally but that live in our small home city where everyone knows/can easily meet each other (we moved out of the country together half a year ago), so it's not like he's liking pictures of friends/acquaintances/random pretty girls etc. He's been doing this for a long time, and we have some history with other girls as well - at the beginning of the relationship he was still talking to his ex, he went out with another girl once without telling me (although I found out)..\nI stopped going on his phone to log on my instagram because sometimes I would unwillingly see his DM's with other girls I never heard of (from our hometown) and it just breaks my heart every time, especially because he always says he doesn't talk to other girls.\nI confronted him about this about three times, I told him it's hurting me, and whenever I see it happening again I feel miserable, but he just gets angry at me and makes me feel even worse. He tells me he doesn't want to bang these girls (although he makes comments about other girls being hot), but he thinks they're pretty (okay, but then why would you want her to know you think she's pretty?).\n\n I'm not a very confident girl and comparing myself to these pretty girls keeps me up all night (sometimes even in my nightmares), it makes me feel worthless, ugly, and desperate. There is nothing I can do to make him stop, he will always think about them and like their pictures. The thing is I just want to feel like I'm enough for a person, like he doesn't care about other girls (the same way I feel for him). It's just making me want to behave the same way with other boys so that he'll see what it feels like (he gets jealous over the tiniest thing), but I know that's wrong. I also don't want to bother him somehow. I think he somehow wants to keep this available guy status online, and although he would never actually cheat on me, something just seems shady. Maybe I sound like a nutty girlfriend type, but I know one thing for sure: my feelings of sadness, inferiority and insecurity are very real. Am I crazy for thinking this way?\n\nThank you for your time and sorry if I made any mistakes in english.\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend acts like he's single and ready to mingle, and likes other girls pictures on instagram (girls he can very easily meet and hook up with), making me constantly compare myself with them."], "endswith": "experience!", "response": null, "intent": null, "acts": null, "classes_in_options": null, "candidates": null, "action": null, "sys_act": null, "condition_response_str": null, "chosen_transform": null, "emotion": null, "document": null, "missing_response": null, "swapped_response": null, "graph": null, "keywords": null, "persona": null, "strategy": null, "slot_label": null, "target": null}, "index": 88363, "split": "train", "dataset": "reddit-advice", "input": "[FINAL PHRASE] experience!

I have to say, I unfairly held a little resentment about that, but it was my decision. I really thought things were going well and we were happy together. A little background to start:\n\nA few times she brought up the idea of having a threesome, same room sex with another couple, or swapping partners with another couple. I told her I wasn't interested in that and felt like it would ruin our relationship, if she wanted to be with other people we should just break up because I couldnt handle it.\n\nA couple we are friends with went on a break in the middle of the spring semester. When we were talking about it, I said I felt that was kind of the same thing as swinging/threesomes... it was just an excuse to fool around with other people and still string along a bf/gf as a backup or safety net to fall back on. We argued about it a little, and I said if she wanted to go on a break we wouldnt be getting back together, we would be breaking up for good.\n\nWell that was a couple months ago and Friday we had reservations at a nice restaurant. We go there, ordered food, were talking like any other dinner date night. The server came with her plate, she had a few bites and the server sat my plate on the table and the second the server walked away my GF said \"I think we should go on a break\"\n\nTo be honest, the next hour was kind of a blur. She had a long list of reasons she thought we should go on a break, but that we would definitely get back together.

To the surprise of many he was persevered with throughout the tournament, coming in at various positions in the batting line-up, despite not being very successful early on. Yet it was his performances at the most crucial stage of the competition that made fans and summarisers take note. Inzamam rose to fame in Pakistan's dramatic semi-final against New Zealand at Auckland. With his side in a precarious position, chasing 262 against an impressive New Zealand side, he hit a fiery 60 run innings from just 37 balls to rescue his side and guide them into the final. The innings was regarded as one of the finest World Cup performances. He hit a massive six in that match which was described by David Lloyd as the shot of the tournament. Inzamam made an equally vital contribution in the final of the World Cup, scoring 42 runs off just 35 balls, helping Pakistan reach a score of 249 after a sluggish start.

{"text": "", "output": "> Mike asked Jim to the back office of the store and pulled out a crack pipe from his pocket", "metadata": {"context": ["My fiance (let's call him Jim) is a recent navy veteran who got a job as a barista a few months ago at a popular coffee chain. We've been engaged for a little over one year now. We live in a major city, and our neighborhood has an incredibly high LGBTQ population. My fiance is attractive, and there have been several instances since he moved here where other men will hit on him. He handles it well, and usually these situations resolve themselves. No big deal.\n\nRecently, he\u2019s been picking up shifts at another location (still in our neighborhood, though). One of the mangers there (let\u2019s call him Mike) is a much older gay man who\u2019s taken a very inappropriate interest in Jim. During Jim\u2019s very first shift at that store, Mike was overly friendly. I guess that Mike has an apartment in the complex over that store, and kept on pressuring Jim to come up to his apartment with him during their break to do drugs. Jim also made the mistake of giving Mike his phone number, because Mike claimed that he needed it to \u201ccontact him about shifts that need to be covered\u201d.\n\nLater that night Jim came home from work. Him and I were watching TV when Mike texted him. Mike was high, and once again kept on pressuring Jim to come over and do meth with him. Jim declined, and Mike started asking him if he \u201clikes guys\u201d as well. Jim is straight, and at this point was feeling really uncomfortable, so he didn\u2019t respond.\n\nThe next time they worked together (a few days later) Mike asked Jim to the back office of the store and pulled out a crack pipe from his pocket, asking Jim if he wanted to take a hit. Jim was quite upset, declined, and finished his shift. Later that night Mike texted him, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you are straight and engaged, if any man has you, it\u2019s going to be me.\u201d\n\nJim, at this point, had enough and told Mike that not only is he straight, he is engaged in a committed relationship. Mike initially apologized and said he would back off. He did for about a week, but Jim says he keeps on coming up to him and asking (basically begging) for the two of them to hang out \u201cas friends\u201d. When Jim declines, Mike starts gushing about what a \u201cwonderful and lovely\u201d person he is and how badly he wants to hang out.\n\nMike continues to text Jim whenever he finds the excuse to do so. Although the texts are not as sexually explicit as before, they are still\u2026 weird. He texts Jim with random reasons why he needs to come into work when he\u2019s off, claiming he needs help installing new shelves, coffee machines, etc. The other day Mike came into the store when Jim was working, said hi, and texted him a bunch of winky-face and licking emojiis right after he left. We all know what that means.\n\nMy fiance is embarrassed, and also is trying to avoid dealing with the situation. I think this Mike guy should be reported to their district manager, but Jim is worried about the repercussions of reporting this guy for sexual harassment. He\u2019s new at the store and up for a big promotion to become a manager himself, and is worried that if he opens a sexual harassment report against this guy it will cause drama in the store and will affect his promotion.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m ready to go after this Mike person myself. The texts he sends infuriate me. I don\u2019t think my fiance is taking this as seriously because since they\u2019re both guys, he doesn\u2019t feel as threatened. My fiance is a fit guy, able to take care of himself, so the threat to his physical safety isn\u2019t as prevalent as it would be in a male-female sexual harassment. I don\u2019t think it matters\u2026. Bi, gay, lesbian, this type of behavior in the workplace is wrong.\n\nHowever I do understand my fiance\u2019s concerns about not wanting to cause drama in a new workplace, especially when he\u2019s up for a promotion. Am I over-reacting? Is there a way to anonymously report this stuff?

[OPTIONS] yes||||no", "index": 83596, "split": "train", "metadata": {"context": ["So I am 21 and I used my I.D. to get into Pussers in downtown Annapolis. The bouncer questioned me my name and address, he asked if I had anything else with my name on it. I only had a debit card that my work gives me as a paycheck and it did not have my name on it, only the company's name on it. He then asked me to write my name down on a piece of paper, just to let you know I've never been through this before or questioned about my I.D., so I wrote my name down and he compared signatures and said they didn't match up. Well yeah because I didn't sign the piece of paper. The bouncer pocketed my I.D. and told me I had to get a cop to verify my I.D. and he would then give it back. We went to the Marriott front desk as the restaurant is connected. Marriott called non-emergency police line to request a cop come by and verify the I.D. while my boyfriend and I were waiting for the cop, my boyfriend ran to my car to get my student I.D. and a debit card with my name on it. My boyfriend arrived before the cop and we tried to show the bouncer my student I.D. and my debit card but he refused to consider it until a cop came by and verified it. I was understanding at this point because I know this might happen a lot. A cop came about a half hour later and heard my side of the story and the bouncers side. I showed the cop my debit card and student I.D. and explained that the debit card I had with me originally didn't have any name on it. The bouncers argument said that I was somewhat hiding the original debit card and that my signature didn't match up. So the cop scanned my I.D. and it was verified that it was a real Maryland I.D. He also told the bouncer that he was pretty sure I was the girl on the I.D. and that the bouncer should give it back. The cop also told me that since it was a private establishment, it was up to the discretion of the bar to give back or keep my I.D. After what the cop told the bouncer, the bouncer refused to give me back my I.D. At this point I was near to tears because I didn't know what to do and I was frustrated because this was my real I.D. and I just wanted it back because I drove to Annapolis. The bouncer asked me to sign again and I did but I know it wasn't the same signature I used from when I was 16.

{"input": "[CONTEXT] it didn\u2019t respond. I know that is it because that is the way he treated anything I did. By being hurt about it and then I feel like the terrible person. I\u2019m tired of feeling like the one who is out of control. I never blamed him. If I did...I would not have stayed for 2 years. So I had a moment of clarity and blocked him. The most telling things is that every single person around me (including friend of his) have confirmed their thoughts about his behavior with me (many times unsolicited upon hearing about our split) and that has helped give me the strength to confirm my real feelings around it all. Suddenly I am not alone and I have friends again. This makes me feel guilty. I have tried to be as objective as possible. But his sister called me as was like how can you do that you are his friend...and that I can forgive and move forward? I told her what I thought and she said that I was being over the top and that these things could be solved wig communication. Thus I am the one without understanding. This leaves me in the same loop. Even typing this up I feel like I am blaming him and blowing things out of proportion...but I\u2019m so hurt by it all. I\u2019m tired of feeling guilty. I know I\u2019m not perfect either and there were definitely times I was short on patience or not my best. I know it won\u2019t kill me to keep him at an arms length. I am going in circles. I know he can\u2019t hurt me from hundreds of miles away. Maybe I am overreacting...I feel like a high schooler instead of a 27 year old woman in this. Am I being abusive or do they have it the other way around? Does this even matter? I know this is long and I appreciate you all giving me an ear. TL;DR: Was I a two year relationship with someone that I am just now understanding may have been emotionally abusive. I blocked them on social media and their sister brought up doubt that I am overreacting and I am being the abusive one for cutting them off and leaving them alone. I am feeling terribly guilty now and don\u2019t know what to do. [RESPONSE] You\u2019re 100% in your right to block them. [ENDOFDIALOGUE] [QUESTION] Is the response appropriate?  [OPTIONS] yes||||no", "index": 161322, "split": "train", "metadata": {"context": ["We dated for two years and in this time, they stopped working, blamed every single one of my friends and family for not likening them or being manipulative or any list of things (my parents weren\u2019t mature, my siblings were spoiled, my friend too possessive etc)and I empathized with them so much that I got really pushed away from literally everyone I knew. This should have been a sign but I had this is us against the world mentality grow over time.\n\nHe was not very emotionally available (in retrospect...I was in deep) and was very pushy about constantly needing to teach me and others about life and could be very holier than thou. He was also passively aggressive in competing with me for my hobbies and the hobbies of others.\n\nFor example, while breaking up with he suddenly asked me where I saw myself in 40 years and I, obviously emotional, pour out my thoughts, to which he replied, \u201cGo and do that.\u201d Like he is guiding me to what letting go is? Like I\u2019m free?? Like some sort of removed sage? I don\u2019t know how to explain it properly...he then proceeded to tell me I was beautiful as I cried...and I did not accept that. Is that normal to say to someone right as you break up with them??\n\nWe could never play games together because I could feel his frustration if I would win and he would passively aggressively make comments or moves to beat me rather aggressively if I started to get the upper-hand. There is being competitive and there is being mean and pretending it\u2019s a joke. I could always feel in my heart it was not kind. When you play for fun...it\u2019s fun. Playing with him was literally never fun. And he would make me feel like I was just a sore loser. I would believe him.\n\nI tried to teach him to cook and he would get frustrated that I was too pushy. He made comments about him not being able to cook because I was someone who just needed to be in control of the kitchen to his family during gatherings. I\u2019ve never had this problems with anyone else I\u2019ve cooked with. But I believed this too.\n\n He was non-committal then committed on and off and I was always trying to figure out if it was just me who was so insecure about it all because he would make me feel like my needs were just me being overly emotional. He would be intimate emotionally with other women, as far as leaving me alone at parties to have extended conversations for hours with new people and said it was because he saw they needed someone there for them...which I understand, but it always seemed off. I thought I was damaged or something or jealous and just couldn\u2019t be emotionally healthy. I had low self-esteem and he said it must be because of my past...but he never tried to tone down these things or really talk to me about them. When I brought them up tactfully as possible, I\u2019d walk away feeling like a psycho girlfriend.\n\nI stopped talking to male friends because I could feel his discomfort! He would act all low and depressed...I thought I was being empathetic but he rules he set for me never applied to him. Again, I\u2019d try to communicate and t would never end well. He would say that if I had these problems that I should break up with him. That I kept bringing up the past. But it\u2019s not the past if it\u2019s repeated behavior.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t let me wear my hair certain ways because he said I was just trying to be less Hispanic, or be something I was not. I was so confused by this and began to analyze my appearance.\n\nHe would do this with my way of dress as well.\n\nHe would also be the kind of person who would tell me to hug or kiss him like I meant it...which was really hurtful and confusing in these moments.\n\nThe first time I had a full meltdown because he refused to just talk to my parents so that we could smooth things over (they are Hispanic and very traditional) he said they were disrespecting HIM by expecting him to adhere to traditions that aren\u2019t his. The only request is that he formally ask them to date me. I know I\u2019m \u201can adult\u201d as he said...but it was tearing me away from my family. He then fell asleep as I was crying and telling him all of this and the stress it was giving me since my family and I were very close and told me after that he had mentioned that he was tired ahead of time...and that was supposed to make it okay I guess?\n\nHe never tried with them after that.\n\nHe says he wants to be a prophet or a teacher but the thing is, he never put these things into practice. He stopped working the whole time we were in a relationship, but literally would stay home stressed out and I would be there stressed out for him thinking he just needed my time and understanding. I took on finances and went as far as to find us a space with a friend. I told him we could just both work hard and get a place of our own and that way none of things he was blaming for his unhappiness would be there. He asked me for help with everything, from homework to even business cars because he wanted to start a business. I always did them. But he never tried. He applied to one job, got rejected and then got more depressed.\n\nMy final straw is that he left back to his home state to help his brother and the day before decided he didn\u2019t want long-distance relationship because, \u201che didn\u2019t want to hurt me.\u201d He then broke up with me after I asked him multiple times what we were doing, then backed up and told me he wanted to marry me half a day later and would come back, then packed up, leaving tons of his stuff behind. By then I was burnt out.\n\nThe next day during his drive he called me like nothing was up...and I was so devastated and it\u2019s like he couldn\u2019t understand this? It was such a whirlwind and it seemed so easy for him to make it seem like all of this happened because he was emotionally drained by me.\n\nHe then broke up with me over the phone a few days after our two year anniversary.\n\nI decided to leave space when he left. 24 days have gone by since last contact...and he hasn\u2019t even called to maybe check in with this person he said was his best friend. I could call, but no exaggeration...when he first left I was always the one who reached out and was devastated. I would be honest with my feelings and sometimes i would cry...but I could feel he was so removed. I feel like the move was an easy way to remove me from his life with another excuse. When he pulled out of the driveway to leave he literally told me he didn\u2019t want to be late...while I was just taking a bit of time to say goodbye.\n\nI wanted to tie up loose ends and decided to to send him the final business cards because I thought I should be straightforward (after he stopped contact,) make good on my word and sent him a friendly email with it attached. It\u2019s been a week and there has been no. response.\n\nIt probably because instead of calling me to talk to me during this time he posted an emotional Facebook post for everyone to see saying that he misses me but that he had to make this change or else nothing would have changed and if he could have made it work...he would have. I did not reach out or act as though I read anything...I was floored. So now he must be hurt about it didn\u2019t respond. I know that is it because that is the way he treated anything I did. By being hurt about it and then I feel like the terrible person.\n\nI\u2019m tired of feeling like the one who is out of control. I never blamed him. If I did...I would not have stayed for 2 years. So I had a moment of clarity and blocked him.\n\nThe most telling things is that every single person around me (including friend of his) have confirmed their thoughts about his behavior with me (many times unsolicited upon hearing about our split) and that has helped give me the strength to confirm my real feelings around it all. Suddenly I am not alone and I have friends again. This makes me feel guilty.

She never pays anything on time and is nearly impossible to deal with in making group purchases to save everyone money. When confronted about not cleaning HER dishes, hers alone, no one else's she acquiesced to this request by rinsing her dishes under a cold tap then putting the dishes, food and all in the cabinet, this results in someone else having to clean not only her dirty dishes but the cleans which are now dirty (we don't have a dish washing machine). She uses the oven often to make very fatty foods, which often spill all over the bottom of the oven and smoke when the oven is turned on but refuses to clean it up (I do my best to control the grease but she insists on cooking everything at like 500 degrees and it bakes on. I told her to clean it after nearly setting our apartment on fire after a particularly greasy incident. Despite numerous times telling her that she is using Bathroom sponges and brushes (shes used the toilet brush to scrub the oven...) and to stop, to which she fully acknowledge our protests but subsequently ignored. Also frustratingly, Pandora does not clean up after herself when it is that time of the month, on numerous occasions she has left a used feminine product in all its glory sitting on our bathroom floor for all to see. She uses expensive products that do no belong to her without permission and zero regard for how much she uses.

I couldn't care less if she want's to live like this if I thought she was truly happy with it and it didn't cause rows between us, but anytime she is out with my friends and their girlfriends are there, she just sits there on her own, never making any attempt to talk to anyone of them.\n\nThe next day she'll be in a bad mood, plain rude to me, short answers, no desire to engage in conversation, i'm guessing she feels awkward about the night before, and then she says that my female friends hate her and are rude to her. From what I can tell they just don't talk to her as she makes no effort herself, they would have no reason to dislike her. If I dare suggest that they aren't rude to her, i'm always told that I side with them and don't listen to her. Honestly, they are not rude to her and anytime she isn't out with me they ask why and send on their regards.\n\nIt's very hard for me to be myself around my friends when the girlfriends are out too, I can't help worrying about her feeling awkward and the next day she is very rude to me, but i put this down to her feeling bad herself about not being able to be sociable.\n\nShe also has no hobbies, I do like to head out and play sport with friends but if this involves me taking a Saturday or Sunday away from her, she will be withdrawn and quiet with me for a day afterwards.\n\nShe always says I never want to do anything with her and gives out to me, I do suggest things, but she doesn't really like going out for drinks, doesn't share any of my hobbies. We end up just walking around and grabbing dinner. She never suggests anything really to me, but I feel like I'm constantly putting on a show for her to keep her happy.\n\nThese issues have caused rows before, anytime we have had fights it's usually been the day after I've gone out with friends or done something without her. She could be up cleaning the place furiously the next day and start screaming at me because I never clean up etc.. I do clean up.\n\nI'm confused, I do love her but I feel like she's abusing me somewhat, I let her live her life as she wants yet she seems to begrudge me having friends and doing my own things and wants to control me.

She\u2019s not entitled to your attention / \u201cfriendship\u201d, especially as you\u2019ve only known her for six months.

After my GCSEs, I had to apply to different schools since mine didn't have a 6th Form attached, so I know barely anyone at my current school.\n\nSince I was new to the school and didn't know the layout, I ended up being late to my first lesson on the first day. As a result of this, almost all of the tables were full and I ended up sitting at a particular table for 2 reasons: I knew one of the girls there because we had met briefly at an open day for a different school & it was one of the few with a seat available.\n\nAs it was the first day, I ended up making small talk with the girl sitting next to the one I knew and this continued for the first few days. Anyway, I thought it was clear that we were just acquaintances until we both made our own friends, however, 6 months on she's still following me around. Literally.\n\nI ended up not 'clicking' with anyone because I'm somewhat socially awkward, but after 5 years of the same thing at secondary school, I was used to it (disappointed, but used to it). She soon began to get on my nerves. I wouldn't mind her so much if she actually had something interesting to say, but all she does is repeat the same question 3 times within 5 minutes & we share no interests whatsoever. I share only 1 out of 4 subjects with her, but she's always around me. She even changed her bus route and bus (which stops right outside her house) to the same as mine (which she has to walk home for about 15 minutes from and is another 10 minute walk from her old bus stop, up a really steep hill) for seemingly no reason other than to sit in silence next to me for 45 mins.\n\nIt's even worse when we have free periods at the same time. She's the type to do her homework as soon as she gets it and that's good for her, it's a quality that I myself lack and would like to acquire. So, when we have free periods, she never has anything to do, so just sits next to me on the computer (taking up one that someone else could be using) and refreshes the homework page for 55 mins, checking her phone periodically every 5 mins. Recently, I discovered my school's computer room which she didn't know about, and used to spend all the time I could away from her there but she followed me one day and now she pops up there as well.\n\nTo avoid her, I leave my house late every morning so that I don't have to talk to her before school, get off the bus stop before my house and walk so that she doesn't know where I live, I blocked her on Snapchat (which I only gave her because she needed some homework help) & I rush out of the lesson as quickly as possible before she can corner me to ask where I'm going for break/lunch (this usually fails). I wouldn't put it past her if she's memorised my timetable.\n\nSince we only have one subject together which alternates every 2 weeks, I've managed to avoid her for a few days at a time when we have none of the same lessons, but she still corners me at break/lunch sometimes. I know she specifically comes looking for me because she'll check the library first and then walk to the computer room to find me.\n\n Now, I realise that I may sound mean. Maybe she's just a loner like me who doesn't have any friends?\n\nWell, no. She has friends that she gets along really well with, always making jokes and laughing together. So I don't know why she's hanging around me. Maybe she sees that I'm alone and is trying to take pity on me and, sure, I haven't outright said that I don't like her, but my body language says enough.

I asked him a big important thing, if he ever hit a girl or anything like that, and he said no, but that \"I was an asshole to women definitely\" and I didn't really know what he meant by that. He told me previously not very much about that era in his life. He told me he worked here or there, but every time I brought it up he just said 'oh not much' and kind of brushed it off. Honestly, I thought he was kind of a loser haha, seeing as how much he loves video games now. Turns out he was kind of the opposite of a loser. The thing is that I like him a lot.

[OPTIONS] yes||||no", "index": 58565, "split": "train", "metadata": {"context": ["Well my boyfriend came clean to me about his past after I got a call from a old 'friend' he had at a rehab clinic asking about him. The friend was someone he knew in rehab, he told me to tell him that he is volunteering at the rehab clinic they both went to. I asked a bit more, he said he was in rehab with my boyfriend in 2006 when my boyfriend was 25. He mentioned one thing, that my boyfriend didn't REALLY need to be there, but that his parents forced him to go. Still, it weirded me out.\n\nI was just really shocked, but I didn't even tell my boyfriend until 5 days later when I brought it up. I told him to just be honest with me, and he sighed and said something about how he wanted to tell me later on. We have been dating for 2 years, how much 'later' on could this have been?\n\nHe just came fully clean, I barely even had to ask any questions. He said when he was in his late teens and early 20s he was part of a sort of scene in brooklyn that partied a lot and did a lot of drugs and such. He apparently sold mushrooms and weed for his sketchy cousin (who I had the unfortunate pleasure to meet, guy is a stereotypical italian gangster type), he got into a lot of fights, he did a lot of coke, he slept around a lot, he apparently carried a gun with him. He worked at his cousins nightclub during a lot of these years and that enabled him to lead that sort of lifestyle. At 24 he went to jail for cocaine, and when he got out his mom guilted him into going to rehab, I mentioned what the guy said on the phone and my boyfriend just said he wasn't at rehab levels really, but it was still good to go there and clear his head. After he continued to deal except more into coke, and then at 26 he just quit dealing completely and went to college. He said he continued to work at his cousins nightclub until he was 31, when he got his current job. He said his coke use slowly declined over the years, and that he toned his lifestyle down after he turned 30. I asked him how many girls he had slept with in total, he literally told me \"I dont even know, probably over 100\" and I was just shocked. I am not some prude, but I assumed we both had the same experience sex wise. I didn't realize he lived THAT kind of lifestyle. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. Dealing coke? Carrying a gun? Fighting and all that other stuff? That is just so... uncharacteristic of him. This makes me think of him entirely differently, I am just so astounded he never even mentioned this massive part of his life. One thing I suppose that might be a factor is that he has gained weight, he said he used to work out every day (hes constantly talking about how 'one day' he will get his six pack back haha), now he is maybe 40~ pounds overweight so maybe it kind of makes him look less... idk, less like the type to fuck over a hundred girls and deal drugs.\n\nI don't really know what to do. If I knew this early on I would have broken up with him. But that is just based on preconceived notions of what he told me, now that I KNOW him... its different. I asked him a big important thing, if he ever hit a girl or anything like that, and he said no, but that \"I was an asshole to women definitely\" and I didn't really know what he meant by that.\n\nHe told me previously not very much about that era in his life.

I asked him a big important thing, if he ever hit a girl or anything like that, and he said no, but that \"I was an asshole to women definitely\" and I didn't really know what he meant by that. He told me previously not very much about that era in his life. He told me he worked here or there, but every time I brought it up he just said 'oh not much' and kind of brushed it off. Honestly, I thought he was kind of a loser haha, seeing as how much he loves video games now. Turns out he was kind of the opposite of a loser. The thing is that I like him a lot. I really fucking do. I actually wanted to marry him, and he said the same thing to me. But there are so many moral problems here. He was some kind of fucking gangster or something before I met him, even if it was years before. And he was an addict, apparently. Or something close to that. He said he was a 'heavy cocaine user' and that he also did a bunch of other stuff. He told me a wound on his back was from a 'camping accident', now he tells me he actually got stabbed in a fight.

{"input": "[CONTEXT] bytecode, you can put whatever values you want in your syntax. Chantelle: The way this relates to marshalling is if i did have a reader that did this and expected the lang it was used with to override `#%datum` in order to detect these special structs, that would work fine and these syntax objects wouldn't exist after expansion. But using the reader with a lang that uses the default definition of `#%datum` would expand it into `(quite &lt;stx object&gt;)`, and _that_ would result in a 3d syntax object surviving to a fully expanded module. Chantelle: So I guess my question is, should the default `#%datum` form with a 3d syntax object be an error? Kimbery: Should it be an error?

But using the reader with a lang that uses the default definition of `#%datum` would expand it into `(quite &lt;stx object&gt;)`, and _that_ would result in a 3d syntax object surviving to a fully expanded module.

[OPTIONS] yes||||no", "index": 162862, "split": "train", "metadata": {"context": ["My half sister and I used to get along until I realized how she really is. She lies all the time, about anything, a pathological liar. She is on her third marriage and this guy was in prison for raping his 15 year old sister when he was 23, and now yells at my mother all the time and abuses animals terribly (mom won't give me the address because she knows I will report him). My sister took my dog to the pound without my knowledge and lied to me for three years about where he was (another story but pretty much the last thing I could stand from her anymore). This is her third husband and she has cheated on all of them. She does not even take a pause from cheating, she does it constantly and puts on a persona of being the sweetest person you ever met. She is my half sister, meaning we have the same mother but different fathers.\n\nFast forward to recently. Her father had been very sick with cancer. I live 9 hours away and am a divorced mom with two teenagers. My sister listed herself as caregiver and my stepfather gave HER power of attorney instead of my mom. My sister took over my stepfather's car, all of the money, etc and started spending it all on herself. She spent it on vacations and bills for her and her new husband while my mother barely had food and could barely pay her bills. My mom called and told me what my sister was doing, said my sister yells at her if she asks for anything from her own money. I tried to help my mother but she refuses. I had a lot of words with my sister over this and tried to help, but my mother kept saying to leave her alone, it's okay, she's the baby. But when my sister wasn't home, my mother would go on a rampage about how my sister was robbing her and spending all of her money and leaving her with all the caregiving to do for my dying stepfather. My sister also ran around with other men while her new husband thought she was taking care of her father.\n\nHer father was not a very nice man. He loved his daughter but the rest of us not so much. My brother hated my stepfather his whole life, but in the last couple of months, he and his wife have been at my mother's house a lot. She told me they stare at her like vultures and keep asking where the money is hidden.\n\nSo my stepfather passed away about two weeks ago. He wanted to be cremated. My sister planned a memorial service. She planned it for the exact same time as our big family reunion, which has been planned for a year. People have rented cabins and hotels to come to this. The reunion itself is Saturday from 10-3. My sister scheduled the funeral for 1:00. The reunion is a full hour away from where the service will be. So most people have said they were not going.\n\nI had decided I was not going to the funeral because my stepfather did not like me, but mainly because there is so much animosity between my sister and her husband and me. She has convinced him that I hate her for no reason. I don't hate her. And the problems I have with her are definitely for a reason. This new husband of hers has decided that when he sees me he is going to confront me. I know this would be a mess. I can bite my tongue a long time, but i am afraid I would end up just telling him all the things about who my sister really is and it would end up with a lot of drama.\n\nSo I sent them flowers and I called to check on my mom every day. I also decided that since none of the people who cause me drama will be at the reunion I would go to that. I live 8 hours from my family reunion, an hour closer than my immediate family is to me. I wanted to see my aunts and uncles and cousins. I wanted to feel like I have a family.\n\nWell tonight my sister in law, her 23 year old daughter, and my sister all got on Facebook and talked about me terribly. I mean really, really, really bad. I have them unfriended so I did not see it. My mother called and asked me what was going on with fb and I had no idea so she told me to look. I could not see pages I had unfriended, but a cousin I asked copied and pasted the conversation to my email, and it was really, really horrible stuff, with all of our extended family tagged in it so they could all see. They were cursing me, calling me names and saying I did not \"have the balls\" to come where they are but that I had the nerve to go to the reunion.\n\nIt is not \"balls\" I lack. I just don't care what they are doing. I am so sick of senseless drama all my life. I moved away to avoid it.\n\nAnyway, part of the things they were posting was my 23 year old, married niece who kept saying \"I only live two and a half hours away, I can drive over there to her ass right now, she won't say shit to me.\" So I messaged my niece and said the only reason I have never said anything was because she was a kid, but now that she is all grown up, and wants to brag to our entire family about how lives so close and I \"won't say shit to her\" to come on over and say whatever she feels like saying. (i NEVER THREATENED TO FIGHT HER, DID NOT IMPLY THAT AT ALL, JUST LETTING HER KNOW WE COULD TALK IN PERSON IF SHE WANTS, SINCE SHE KEPT SAYING i WAS AFRAID OF HER). I sent her my address. I told her it was an open invitation. So she told her mother. Now her mother says that I am now \"picking on her child\" and that she is going to beat my ass. She told my brother (he does not read facebook) that I was picking on their child. (Their child called me every name in the book and talked about me like I was a dog. I did not threaten her - I am not a fighter - but yes, if she is so bold to say that I am afraid to say anything to her and brag how close she lives, come on over - that's all I said). So now they are all mad at me and want me to \"have some balls\" (I am a female) and meet them somewhere between the funeral and the reunion so that my sister in law can \"beat my ass.\"\n\nI have no desire to be in a fight when I am 48 years old. Especially over something so ridiculous. And I am certainly not going to go to jail for these crazy people. I have a good job that I want to keep. I'm a divorced mom with teenaged kids.

THE RIVAL AUCTIONEERS. It may well be imagined that Matt read Ida Bartlett's letter with great interest. The young auctioneer had never received a communication as surprising as was this one. He went over every word carefully several times, then placed the letter in his pocket, and started off to find Andy. Half an hour later he came across his partner on the main street. Andy had just rented a store, one of two vacant ones which were side by side, and was now on his way to drive the wagon around and unload the stock. \"Well, did you get a letter, Matt?\" \"I did.\" \"Good enough. Any special news?\" \"Yes, indeed. Just read that.\" And the young auctioneer passed the communication over for his partner's perusal. Andy read the letter as carefully as had Matt. He emitted a long, low whistle. \"What do you think of it?\" \"I hardly know what to think, Matt.
