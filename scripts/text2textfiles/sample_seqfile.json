What they cite here as findings are actually discussions of the legal issues raised by the State court complaint under State law. They don't amount to a factual finding. There was no trial. There was no summary judgment motion. There was no evidence presented on any of these points. These are -- CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: How did the case go up? On a motion to dismiss? MR. UTRECHT (PETITIONER): The case in State court went up on a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the trial court, reversed by the State court of appeal, and then affirmed by the California Supreme Court.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, you mentioned cutting off a whole category of claims. And, earlier, you said they didn't want to give a pass to this kind of a claim. But this is not a pass, because there are all sorts of remedies retained -- derivative suits, 49-person actions, and so forth. And are you aware -- you mentioned the 100 years of State precedent -- is there any precedent in the State law for class actions for holder claims? MR.

FREDERICK (RESPONDENT): -- but it was -- JUSTICE STEVENS: -- is not a case where we have a 100-year body of law of class action after class action brought on State-law grounds for this type of claim. MR. FREDERICK (RESPONDENT): True. But, in the '90s, you had a unique form of fraud that was being perpetrated on Wall Street that did affect holders in a unique way. And we've highlighted market timing in our briefs. In that circumstance, it would be futile for 49 holders to get together and assert that they had been harmed by market timing, because the aggregate of their harm is so small that you really have to look at it in a large context. John Vogel, the head of Vanguard for many years, and one of most respected mutual-fund advisors, says that there are as many as $5 billion lost by people who buy and hold, as we've been taught to do by Wall Street, but whose aggregate losses accrete every year by virtue of market timing. That is a unique harm caused to holders, which, under their theory, would not be cognizable, because it would be preempted, and it would be impossible, as a practical matter, for someone to get together with 48 of his or her fellow victims and try to bring a claim to redress that.

FREDERICK (RESPONDENT): -- but it was -- JUSTICE STEVENS: -- is not a case where we have a 100-year body of law of class action after class action brought on State-law grounds for this type of claim. MR. FREDERICK (RESPONDENT): True. But, in the '90s, you had a unique form of fraud that was being perpetrated on Wall Street that did affect holders in a unique way. And we've highlighted market timing in our briefs. In that circumstance, it would be futile for 49 holders to get together and assert that they had been harmed by market timing, because the aggregate of their harm is so small that you really have to look at it in a large context. John Vogel, the head of Vanguard for many years, and one of most respected mutual-fund advisors, says that there are as many as $5 billion lost by people who buy and hold, as we've been taught to do by Wall Street, but whose aggregate losses accrete every year by virtue of market timing. That is a unique harm caused to holders, which, under their theory, would not be cognizable, because it would be preempted, and it would be impossible, as a practical matter, for someone to get together with 48 of his or her fellow victims and try to bring a claim to redress that.

NEAL CONAN, HOST: The FAA cited cases where lack of sleep led to procedural errors, unstable approaches, lining up with the wrong runway and landing without clearance. The new rules call for shorter shifts and longer rest periods between flights. They do not apply to cargo pilots, and commercial airlines have two years to implement them. NEAL CONAN, HOST: So for now, pilots, when do you sleep? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. Go to npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST: Later in the program, Georgetown professor Philip Carver on the homework assignment of a lifetime. But first, Bart Jansen joins us here in Studio 3A. He covers FAA and Transportation Security Administration for USA Today. Nice to have you with us. BART JANSEN: Thanks for having me. NEAL CONAN, HOST: And these new rules, as we mentioned in response to that crash in Buffalo, the Colgan crash, was fatigue specifically cited there? BART JANSEN: The NTSB did not blame fatigue specifically in that crash, but they did note the pilots didn't necessarily sleep in a bed the night before the crash. They were heard yawning on the cockpit recorder. And so the relatives of the victims have used that flight to really push for these changes, and Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood credited those families with keeping the pressure on and keeping an eye on fatigue.

If the police do have to get a warrant, they are entitled to search anywhere and everywhere in the premises; whereas, in this case, one of Respondent's main claims is that she wasn't credible. Well, if she wasn't credible, and she had led the police upstairs, and the police had found nothing, that might have been the end of the whole incident. And I think that it's because of the socially valuable function of efficiently resolving accusations, potentially dueling accusations of criminal conduct that consent searches can facilitate, that this Court has said that consent searches are a positive social good and should be encouraged, rather than discouraged.

{"input": "[CONTEXT] UNKNOWN_SPEAKER: I spoke with Jim McAndrews late this afternoon. I told him EOTT was interested in following up on the possibility of settling the case, which he left open after the trial. He said that, after trial, London concluded they wanted to, in essence, buy out all of Enron Corp's coverage and were not interested in settling the case on its own. They corresponded with Jim Studdert a few times during the winter, but Jim responded in a way that John said was rude. If we are interested in talking about a buy-out, London would be interested. I told him that would be very difficult for EOTT to arrange, as it is not the sole insured. I asked if buying out just EOTT's coverage was a possibility. He pointed out that there is a strong connection between the two (Enron's listing in Martindell lists EOTT's attorneys, he claims) and thinks it could be done as one package. In any event, London really wants to deal with all the coverage under the Internorth policies. I told him I had heard about the buy-out campaign elsewhere and had forwarded material to Studdert on that issue. I need to follow-up with Studdert and Duffy to figure out where Enron/EOTT is on this issue now. I asked what number his people would be willing to pay just to settle the Ashland claim, in the likely event that there could be no buy-out. He said he would need to talk with London about that.
