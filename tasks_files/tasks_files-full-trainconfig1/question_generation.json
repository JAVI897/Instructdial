And unfortunately, that might be the case with the troubled political satire, \"War, Inc.\" John Cusack co-wrote and stars in the dark comedy about a professional hit man who is hired by an American corporation to kill a Middle Eastern oil baron.

MARK JORDAN LEGAN: The film sat on the shelf for awhile, and many of the critics think it should have stayed there. USA Today calls it intriguing if flawed.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there -- there are two situations. I mean, one can supplement without frustrating.

I mean, it's six of one, half a dozen of the other. It's a happenstance. MR. DREEBEN (PETITIONER): Well, in this case, as in many other cases involving this kind of potential incident, the wife called the police to the scene. So, there was a reason for them to be on the scene. It was a perfectly valid investigatory step. And once they acquired the information relating to drugs on the premises, and had the authority of someone who's in charge of the premises, I submit that the police should be able to conduct the search as a reasonable matter under the Fourth Amendment, just as they would if Respondent had been asleep or if Respondent had said, \"Well, I have to go now. Am I free to go?\" and the police said that, \"You are.\" And I don't think that it always would be an advantage for the nonconsenting tenant, somebody like Mr. Randolph, to insist on the police getting a warrant or conducting a probable-cause arrest. If he's arrested, he's taken down to the station, he has a search incident to arrest, he may not get a hearing for 48 hours. If the police do have to get a warrant, they are entitled to search anywhere and everywhere in the premises; whereas, in this case, one of Respondent's main claims is that she wasn't credible. Well, if she wasn't credible, and she had led the police upstairs, and the police had found nothing, that might have been the end of the whole incident. And I think that it's because of the socially valuable function of efficiently resolving accusations, potentially dueling accusations of criminal conduct that consent searches can facilitate, that this Court has said that consent searches are a positive social good and should be encouraged, rather than discouraged.

The other route would involve following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor. The only issue there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system. Other Preliminary Project Issues There are other fundamental issues to address. The original concept was to interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline. Transwestern's original estimate to construct a 16\" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was based on the following specifications 120 MMcf/d 450 psig delivery pressure, 900 psig inlet pressure The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse turbines). In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's. In order to accommodate EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the design will likely change to a 20\" pipeline.

What Congress did not do -- and the Solicitor General concedes it did not do -- is create a Federal private right of action for quiet title claims in disputes between two private parties. JUSTICE SCALIA: How did Congress -- surely Congress did not expect any pronouncement of -- of title by the Federal Government to be immune from challenge by private individuals. If Congress did not anticipate that a wrongful assertion of title through the Federal Government could be challenged by a State action of this sort to clear title, how did Congress expect it ever to be challenged?

I agree with those who have responded so far that the cons probably outweigh the pros of having joint business school sponsorship. I see some resons to narrow down date choices. Not Nov. 2 or 3 because too much of GSPP will be away at the APPAM conference in Seattle. Nov. 6-10 is election week, and that would detract from the press coverage we ought to get.

Later than this begins to get into end of classes, finals, etc. On format, I'm thinking about how to combine high-visibility players with academics to make for a productive discussion. Possibly we might want 2-3 people on each panel as \"speakers\" and 1 other person as a \"discussant\" to respond to speaker ideas. Maybe the discussants should be academics, the speakers high-visibility players (who are known to have opposing views in some interesting way). Perhaps there should be a brief keynote speaker (e.g. Feinstein 10-15 mins), then a single academic to give a brief history of the deregulation movement (20 mins.), then two panels (short-run problems and solutions, long-run problems and solutions). We might want at least one speaker who can bring in some non-US experience, like England's since they are much further down the deregulation road than we are. Except for the \"Feinstein\" opening role, I'd like the other speakers to be really knowlegable about this area (i.e. more than just highly-visible people). Rich Gilbert from our econ. dept. is another possible academic (he preceded Borenstein as head of the University's Energy Research shop, and then did a Washington tour as chief economist of DOJ; he's also a founder of Law & Economics Consulting), who might be good on the \"long-run\" panel if we go that way.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, you mentioned cutting off a whole category of claims. And, earlier, you said they didn't want to give a pass to this kind of a claim. But this is not a pass, because there are all sorts of remedies retained -- derivative suits, 49-person actions, and so forth. And are you aware -- you mentioned the 100 years of State precedent -- is there any precedent in the State law for class actions for holder claims? MR. FREDERICK (RESPONDENT): Well, we think the Weinberger case recognized that class actions could be brought, under New York law. It was a Federal case -- JUSTICE STEVENS: But this -- MR. FREDERICK (RESPONDENT): -- but it was -- JUSTICE STEVENS: -- is not a case where we have a 100-year body of law of class action after class action brought on State-law grounds for this type of claim. MR. FREDERICK (RESPONDENT): True. But, in the '90s, you had a unique form of fraud that was being perpetrated on Wall Street that did affect holders in a unique way. And we've highlighted market timing in our briefs. In that circumstance, it would be futile for 49 holders to get together and assert that they had been harmed by market timing, because the aggregate of their harm is so small that you really have to look at it in a large context. John Vogel, the head of Vanguard for many years, and one of most respected mutual-fund advisors, says that there are as many as $5 billion lost by people who buy and hold, as we've been taught to do by Wall Street, but whose aggregate losses accrete every year by virtue of market timing. That is a unique harm caused to holders, which, under their theory, would not be cognizable, because it would be preempted, and it would be impossible, as a practical matter, for someone to get together with 48 of his or her fellow victims and try to bring a claim to redress that.

Eugena: <@Andreas> `conditional-require` just passes one of its arguments through, so the thing being required has the scopes of the macro use. In contrast, `require/from-env` is *creating* a new syntax object, and by default it gets a scope marking it as originating from your macro. Andreas: I understand why it is unhygienic because it inserts new bindings based on what the required file provides. However, this is surely possible somehow and I cannot understand how it's different from `conditional-require`. I haven't actually tested `conditional-require` although I assumed it works.

But even before today's meetings, Latin American leaders - including the vice president of Brazil - were explicitly ruling out military intervention in Venezuela.

As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for the financial confirmations without adding any staff. Fifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston. Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the transaction being done. We feel this time line could be met if we did the financial confirmations here. This reduces risk for Enron. Finally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my existing employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the company in order to broaden their knowledge base. Given the skill sets of the documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas such as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to keep them challenged within the documentation group. Because we review the confirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already exists. However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full accountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations. As a final note, I report to you. I am fully accountable to you for ensuring that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function properly.

It doesn't seem to capture what is admitted into the mails, and it doesn't seem to capture the important decisions that are made -- it may not seem so important, in this one case, to have put the mail on the porch, but multiply it by tens of millions of times a day when that decision is made, and the decision that that balance, of putting things there in a sheltered way, hopefully that will both protect the mail and the people, instead of either reverting to person-to-person delivery for all oversized mail or making people come down, like the old days, to the Post Office to pick it up.

Another is to change `apply-tag` from a syntax object bound using `#,with` to a procedure-valued attribute bound with `#,attr` that takes the contextual information and produces the syntax. The caller of the syntax-class would have to get the procedure attribute and call it with the necessary information. Penni: <@Eileen> I'm actually calling a syntax-time function elsewhere, for a different purpose. The rough spot here is that I need to pass all the attributes from the `taggee-info` syntax class. I suppose I could package them all up in some big list, or maybe `attribute` will do that, but then I have to parse them all out again\u2014and I'll have to change this code every time I modify `taggee-info`. Not an insurmountable challenge, but I wonder if there's some nice way to pass all the contextual information that `#,with` already has access to right inside the `applies-to` syntax class.

But I think they would say it's not enough. It's not enough to impose accountability for the crime of sexual abuse. There also has to be accountability for the cover-up of that crime.

However, stay and abeyance erodes each side of this triangular statutory design. Stay and abeyance allows tolling in Federal court when Duncan said there should be none. It extends the statute of limitations beyond 1 year, and it ignores the total exhaustion requirement of 2254(b).

The call option is posted for a specific quantity, start date, etc. There are no other variables. It's just price. From our discussions with Mike Coleman and crew on this topic -- I think is it absolutely key that we keep the award variables to a minimum. My take is that the transmittal letter referring to highest price is the right way to go. The concept in the tariff about posting the evaluation criteria (implying that there are more variables) could kill the deal. Drew.Fossum: To synthesize what I'm hearing from you and MKM (and Mr. Ni), our story is that we will post for sale an option with a specific MDQ, type (i.e., European option or American or whatever), flow period, and points. For example, we'd post a European call on 10,000/d of Nov. 01--March 02 Permian to Topock firm capacity with an exercise date of Jan 1, 2001. the customer would bid an option price and a transport rate.

I am worried that too many of the signatories can be accused of trying use their academic positions to achieve results desired by their consulting clients. I riase this issue because more than one person has told me that \"Paul Joscow is owned by Edison.\" While such statements are generally wrong I believe you need to be sensitive to the potential attack. In particular, I worry that our efforts will be undermined if too many of the individuals signing the report have had extensive dealings with the state's three largest utilities. I can just see the headline \"Apologists for utilities offer solutions to state's energy problems.\" You know we will be attacked after we issue the manifesto. The question is, will the attacks have merit. If we were all white as the driven snow there would be no problem. However, under such circumstances we would all be poor. For this reason it is important to get independent academics and non-academics with no connections to the utilities or generators to sign the manifesto. I fall into this later category as, I believe, do a number of other individuals. The addition of Solow would obviously help as would Arrow or McFadden. Dale Jorgenson would also be a great addition because he has never worked or testified for these firms. The same goes for Paul Krugman. On the other hand, Pual brings some heavy baggage.

NEAL CONAN, HOST: The FAA cited cases where lack of sleep led to procedural errors, unstable approaches, lining up with the wrong runway and landing without clearance. The new rules call for shorter shifts and longer rest periods between flights. They do not apply to cargo pilots, and commercial airlines have two years to implement them.

And one of the things that really is critical, we think, is that one of the things that happened in between that, of course, was the ice age. IRA FLATOW, HOST: Oh. CROCKFORD: And so a lot of places where some of the other fossils have been found in Europe actually were covered in glaciers during that ice age period. IRA FLATOW, HOST: Mm-hmm. CROCKFORD: So it's a really important blockage... IRA FLATOW, HOST: Yeah. CROCKFORD: ...of things going on in Europe. And one of the things that we noticed was that while this specimen was found before the ice age, there are no specimens similar to it that continue on through the ice age period or after in that same area of Siberia. That area of Siberia actually wasn't covered by glaciers, and so people still live there. And even still, there are no similar specimens that carry on through time. IRA FLATOW, HOST: Mm-hmm. And so is there still this big gap between 12,000 and 33,000 years of knowledge of what happened there? CROCKFORD: Yes. There are several more specimens similar to this one that we found that were found in Belgium, the Czech Republic and around the Caucasus in Southern Europe and - that are similar to this and about the same - from the same time period.

I thought it was still a HAMT Shanell: We tried (er, no pun intended) both (and a HAMT is still in the repo, I believe). The HAMT does have better memory usage but it's slower on most operations. Shanell: My best guess is that this is because creating a new HAMT node involves creating a new vector (which also has to zero out the memory) and then `vector-set!`-ing the whole thing. So, each slot is written to twice, and each write has to go through a GC write barrier. But this is really just a guess. Kristeen: I don't think the zeroing would trigger the write barrier, but that's all very interesting Shanell: No, you're right. Only the second write goes through the barrier. Shanell: BTW, one of my reasons for suspecting vector writes as the culprit is that a version of the HAMT that stores a cons cell (containing the name/value pair) in each slot performed better than one that uses a flat vector twice the size. Shanell: I don't think so Priscila: Apropos, did Chez get immutable cons cells? Priscila: ok Clarinda: Many things prevent multiple instantiation. Some of it is that global hooks are installed or global classes (for Objective-C) defined. Some of it is that GUI toolkits do not support running in multiple OS threads.

Pat said that to post it in the Energy Sense format (MDEF) would be very difficult because of how the system operates. Pat also confirmed that they do not post data from all MV90 accounts to the MDMA on a daily basis. I asked her if they could change this process and she said that it was something they have been wanting to do, but it has not been a high priority. I recommend that we get the daily CSV file from the FTP server and import it into the Load Database that John Rutledge is developing. Pat says that if we can have the Work Request completed today, we could have this set up next week. The best scenario is for all the data to be posted to the MDMA daily, so we can possibly get CSC to make this a high priority.

Just asking because everyone but me is, it would appear. Any new news in that department for you? I have started seeing someone new, but it is really casual and really new. He is another lawyer and from St. Albert, Alberta of all places! Met him at a cocktail part for Canadian lawyers working in New York. Speaking of which, I am coming up on my one year anniversary of living here (and of having a real job) and am loving both living here and work. No complaints. Am off to my best friend from law school's wedding in Vancouver in Sept so I am taking a week off then, other than that no big vacay planned for the summer. And you? I do plan on going to visit a close friend who is moving to Paris in the fall so I'll likely go for American Thanksgiving, but that's about it. Meghan was here visiting when she was back in June. Liles came to town the same w/e. Shauna Snow (who is also engaged) and Jackie Boase came here for a visit as well in early May. We had a blast, of course. Liles came as well that w/e. The parents made their first trip to the big city in March and had a fabulous time and have already planned their top ten things to do during their next visit. It has been a good year for having people come visit (even though my dorm room at UofA was bigger than my apt, we all survived). How is your fam? Dev said he was at Matt's stag party and Danny came home and surprised him. That's cool. I guess that wedding is this w/e. Did he go to Dion and Suzanne's wedding?
